10001,MGT402,Basics of Accounting,M  W 10:10 AM-11:30 AM,"Nakhmurina, Anya",2,Core,N,N,,"The course helps students acquire basic accounting knowledge that is extremely useful in the day-to-day practice of general management. This basic accounting knowledge is indispensable background for the work to follow in the Organizational Perspectives courses as well as for elective courses in accounting, finance, marketing, and strategy. Accounting systems provide important financial information for all types of organizations across the globe. Despite their many differences, all accounting systems are built on a common foundation. Economic concepts, such as assets, liabilities, and income, are used to organize information into a fairly standard set of financial statements. Bookkeeping mechanics compile financial information with the double entry system of debits and credits. Accounting conventions help guide the application of the concepts through the mechanics. This course provides these fundamentals of accounting."
10002,MGT403,Probability Modeling & Statistics,M  W 10:10 AM-11:30 AM,"Seim, Katja",2,Core,Y,N,,"The ability to understand and apply probability concepts and statistical methods is fundamental to management education. The concepts covered in this course include probability, simulation, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and applied regression modeling. This course provides a foundation of basic statistical concepts that are essential for many other courses at SOM. These materials surface routinely in students’ Organizational Perspectives courses and electives and are useful for decision-making applications in financial analysis, marketing, operations management, and other areas."
10003,MGT404,Basics of Economics,M  W 8:30 AM-9:50 AM,"Yang, Kai Hao",2.5,Core,N,N,,"This course concentrates on the role of market processes in determining the opportunities facing individuals and business firms, the policy issues facing public officials, and the patterns of resource allocation in the economic system. It is intended to be accessible to students with little or no prior exposure to economics. The mathematical prerequisite is competence with basic algebra and calculus. The aim is to provide students with analytical tools to help them tackle economic problems, which arise whenever agents must make economic trade-offs or engage in trade. While we cover a range of topics in microeconomics, the emphasis throughout the course is on learning how to approach and tackle economic problems—a skill that will be useful in making managerial decisions. Topics include supply and demand, consumers, production, equilibrium, imperfect competition, competitive strategy."
10004,MGT405,Modeling Managerial Decisions,M  W 10:10 AM-11:30 AM,"Jain, Anjani",2,Core,Y,N,,"Through this course students will learn how to approach, analyze and solve complex problems in a structured way. Specifically students will learn to i) view problems through multiple lenses and think across disciplines to clarify and define problems; ii) extract important information from a complex situation; iii) develop the ability to model these problems in a quantitative manner using tools in Excel; iv) learn linear optimization techniques for problems with multiple decisions and constraints; v) find out how to examine assumptions and biases that often distort decisions and understand risk in uncertain decision making environments; and vi) learn how to use decision trees to inform the analysis of situations with uncertainty. The course will survey a variety of management decision problems arising from finance, marketing, microeconomics, and operations. A particular emphasis will be placed on examples involving setting up financial models of discounted cash flows. Students are expected to bring their laptops to class in order to participate in quantitative exercises."
10005,MGT510,Data Analysis and Causal Inference,M  W 1:00 PM-2:20 PM,"Jensen, Robert",2,Economics,Y,N,,"The most important questions in business, public policy and beyond often revolve around understanding how some variable X affects some other variable Y. For example: How will demand for my product respond to a change in price? Will advertising increase demand for my product? Does this microfinance project seeking funding from my organization reduce poverty? Should I hold back my child a year before they start school? Will the outcome of the next election affect the value of my stock portfolio? 
  This course will examine when and how data can be used specifically to infer whether there is a causal relationship between two variables. We will emphasize the role of theory in interpreting data and guiding analysis, and explore advanced techniques for inferring causality, including: regression discontinuity designs; matching estimators; instrumental variables; synthetic controls; event studies; heterogeneity modeling; audit studies; randomized controlled trials; natural experiments (and unnatural experiments); and A/B testing. 
  Lectures will contain some proofs and derivations (only calculus is required), but the emphasis will be on understanding the underlying concepts, and the practical use, implications and limitations of these techniques. Students will work intensively with data, drawing from examples in business and public policy. The goals of the course are for students to become expert consumers and producers of convincing causal empirical analysis."""
10006,MGT537,Inequality and Social Mobility,T  Th 10:10 AM-11:30 AM,"Biasi, Barbara",2,Economics,N,N,Data-driven econ approach to inequality. Manageable assignments. Great for those interested in societal issues.,"This course offers a comprehensive overview of current trends in inequality and social mobility, both locally and globally, shedding light on potential factors contributing to these trends and the consequential impact of public policies on societal dynamics.

The course is structured as a data-driven exploration into the many drivers of economic disparities, such as income distributions, racial segregation, access to high-quality education, labor market policies, and the evolving landscape of technology, including AI. Drawing from academic studies and policy reports, we will discuss the interplay between these factors and the economic opportunities they present across different generations.

Through lectures and participative discussions centered around assigned readings, this course aims to equip you with the analytical tools necessary to critically assess empirical research, public commentary, and policy documents within the scope of the course material. Assessment will be based on active class engagement, one/two assignments, and a final group project. The course starts on September 3; we will schedule a make-up class later in the course."
10007,MGT538,Mastering Influence & Persuasion,M  W 8:30 AM-9:50 AM,"Chance, Zoe",2,Marketing,N,N,,"Set the stage for achieving your goals through ongoing mastery of influence and persuasion in a boot camp-style intensive course. Help you become a person people increasingly want to say yes to.    Whether you have formal authority or not, your effectiveness as a leader and change agent depends on your ability to influence others to want to follow you. To want to say Yes. In this boot camp practicum, you'll study research findings and discuss tools like handling resistance and using other people's standards for themselves, but the real work and real benefit happens outside of class. You'll put influence into practice with weekly G-Force challenges to help you gain useful skills, shift your thinking, and build resilience. Although you'll learn some red flags to watch out for so you can protect yourself against would-be manipulators, and we'll discuss how to handle difficult people, we focus on making influence more comfortable and fun for all parties. Because then you'll be more likely to use it. Which means you'll be a stronger leader, better able to shape the world around you. Research shows nice people DO finish first—but """"nice"""" might be different from what you thought. Find out for yourself."
10008,MGT559,Marketing Strategy,M  W 8:30 AM-9:50 AM,"Shin, Jiwoong",2,Marketing,N,N,,"This course offers students the opportunity to develop skills and acquire experience in dealing with strategic marketing problems. The course aimes at helping students look at the entire marketing mix in light of the strategy of the firm. The course builds on the foundation developed in core courses, and the basic framework rests on the recent development in economics and strategy – resource based view (RBV) of strategy. You will have a chance to illustrate your ability to apply this framework in this course through case discussion and an in-class final exam. It will be most helpful to students pursuing careers in which they need to look at the firm as a whole. Examples include consultants, investment analysts, entrepreneurs, and product managers. Case studies will highlight marketing strategy exercise in consumer packaged goods, high tech, pharmaceuticals, and luxury goods."
10009,MGT582,The Future of Global Finance,Th 1:00 PM-4:00 PM,"Garten, Jeffrey",2,Finance,N,N,,"Please note that in order to enroll in the course, you must attend the first class meeting on Thursday, October 26. Additionally, please note that there will be an assignment due prior to the first class. Auditing is not permitted. Course description: Finance can be likened to the circulatory system of the global economy, and we will focus on the past, present and future of that system. The course is designed to deal with questions such as these: What is the global financial system and how does it work? What are the pressures on that system including market, regulatory, political and social dynamics? What are the key challenges to that system? How can the system be strengthened? In this course we are defining the global financial system (GFS) as encompassing central banks, commercial banks, and other financial institutions such as asset managers and private equity firms, financial regulators and international organizations. Thus we will encompass subjects such as the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, Goldman Sachs and the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank, the Carlyle Group and the BlackRock Investment Management Co., the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Financial Stability Board, the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund. We will take a broad view of the GFS including its history, its geopolitical framework, its economic foundations and its legal underpinnings. We will consider the GFS as a critical public good in the same way that clean air is a public good. We will look at a number of other key issues such as how the GFS deals with economic growth, economic and financial stability, distributional questions, employment issues, and long term investments in infrastructure. We will discuss how new technologies are affecting several of the biggest issues in global finance. We will examine the GFS as a large-scale complex network, thereby compelling us to see it in an interconnected and multidisciplinary way. The emphasis will be on the practice of global finance more than the theory."
10010,MGT627,Business and Government After Communism,T  Th 10:10 AM-11:30 AM,"Shapiro, Ian",2,Strategy,N,N,,"The collapse of the USSR and its satellites recast business-government relations across the former communist world. New markets developed, state assets were privatized, and novel business ventures proliferated. Even China, which retained its Communist political system, joined the capitalist economic order with a vengeance at home and abroad. The end of the Cold War also reshaped business-government relations in the West, as the threatening shadow of an alternative to capitalism “out there” vanished.  This course explores the business-government nexus in this evolving context. The goal is to rethink business’s place in society, and its relations with government, in an era when alternatives to capitalism are moribund. The motivating thought is that unless business is part of the solution to major social and political challenges – from sustaining democracy to feeding populations to managing health and environmental threats – it will likely be part of the problem. We examine cases in which new business roles have been more and less successful to chart the emerging landscape and develop accounts of best practices and pitfalls to avoid. As well as the older capitalist democracies, we will study Russia, China, India, Vietnam, Cuba, South Africa, Israel, Palestine, and the Gulf states in the Middle East."
10011,MGT636,Global Leadership: Personal & Interpersonal Effectiveness,T 4:10 PM-7:10 PM,"Tate, David",2,Strategy,N,Y,,"Leaders for business and society need an array of competencies, but for leaders who work in global/multinational environments, there are additional skills, abilities, and knowledge needed to be successful. This course is designed to help students learn about and practice the mindsets and skills necessary to be more flexible, resilient, and confident when working across geographic, interpersonal and cultural contexts. The central focus is to increase students’ personal and interpersonal skills necessary for more effective leadership in global contexts."

Surveys, midterm, final. Great for various entrepreneurial paths.","The purpose of this course is to provide students with an opportunity to explore being an entrepreneur by purchasing a company, rather than starting one from scratch. The readings and class discussions will help students understand how to purchase a business, finance an acquisition, and operate and grow a business. The cases and conversations will help students understand what it is like being a young, first time CEO and what types of challenges and issues will be encountered.
The general course structure will follow the lifecycle of an entrepreneur who purchases a business to operate. The first few session will explore the concept of entrepreneurship through acquisition and how this compares to different forms of entrepreneurship and its pros and cons. How to purchase a business and what type of business to purchase will be examined. How to operate and grow a business as a young, first time CEO will be considered. What happens when a business works well and when it does not work well will be discussed. Finally, how and when to sell a business and what that means for the entrepreneur and business will be reviewed. This course will require active participation in class.

Low-medium workload, eye-opening data.","This course will focus on insurance, savings, credit and other financial services for the poor. We will use the tools of economic theory and quantitative analysis to explore these topics, including: the potential role these instruments play as drivers of well-being, poverty alleviation, income growth and social and economic development; why households lack access to these instruments; and potential solutions. We will consider the role played by the state, market and broader society, including both the formal and informal sectors. We will focus primarily on low income countries, but the underlying concepts and examples will apply to low income households in wealthier countries."

However, the reality is challenging. Entrepreneurs find it tough, with 30% of galleries running at a loss and over 90% of artists unable to live from their work. How can entrepreneurs succeed? Why does Gagosian turn over a billion while the average gallery makes only $200k? What impact will Web3 have? Can new models replace auction houses and art fairs?
This course offers students firsthand insights into the art market through theoretical analysis and guest experts. Past speakers included Jeff Koons, KAWS, and Noah Horowitz (CEO of Art Basel). Students will shape these sessions, challenge the experts, and develop their own perspectives.

10019,MGT851,Strategic Market Measurement,T  Th 8:30 AM-9:50 AM,"Sudhir, K.",2,Strategy,Y,N,Some find it chaotic. Covers cluster analysis and encourages ChatGPT. Medium workload. May feel redundant if taken other analytics.,"Any company is confronted with management decision problems that require collection and analysis of data, as well as managerial knowledge and experience to interpret the data correctly. “Strategic Market Measurement” will equip you with practical data analysis tools to implement marketing strategies you have learned in the core “Customer” course. It is a prerequisite for “Listening to the Customer” (MGT 852) - if offered in Fall 2 - where you learn how to collect the right qualitative and quantitative data in order to answer management decision problems. “Strategic Market Measurement” is thus the first part of a classic “Marketing Research” class offered in most MBA programs, but can also be taken separately if you would like to get a “hands-on” introduction to basic data analysis concepts and tools. This course is also a good preparation for the MGT 556 (“Big Data for Customer Analytics”) and MGT 869 (“Machine Learning for Customer Analytics”) offered in the Spring. After successful completion of “Strategic Market Management,” you will be able to 1) conduct data analysis techniques such as  Hypothesis testing, A/B testing (which is frequently used to test website designs, products, email marketing, …),  Logistic regression and discriminant analysis (which is frequently used for one-to-one marketing, targeting, …),  Cluster Analysis (which is frequently used for market segmentation, determination of the competitive set, …),    Factor analysis, perceptual maps (which is used for positioning of a brand, dealing with multi-collinearity in regressions, …),  Conjoint analysis (which is frequently used for new product development and market simulations). 2)choose and apply the correct tool to implement marketing strategies. 3)evaluate how a specific data analysis tool can inform your marketing strategies and understand the limitations of each statistical analysis. We will first practice each concept using simple, small data sets for educational purposes and then apply them to ""real"" data that I am collecting from a pre-course student survey. The group projects, the final assessment of your learning in this course, will consist of an application to company data."""

Through a mix of case studies and lectures, the course brings together a variety of issues unique to markets significantly impacted by technologies. The course is divided into 4 modules. Each module will feature a lecture session laying out the conceptual foundations followed by 2-3 case studies. We investigate reasons that we observe a variety of business models in the market for digital products and services, and identify outcomes to assess the performance of business models and the challenges in implementing them. Second, we focus on understanding strategies and how business models can be used by disruptors and complementors, with a view to evaluating how each of these could be successful in the marketplace. Third, we study platforms to understand the primary issues in developing multi-sided platforms as well as the perspective of participants on each side. Fourth, we examine technology-driven transformation both from a technology perspective (with AI and blockchain as key emerging technologies), as well as from a firm perspective (with The New York Times)."

10022,MGT895,International Real Estate,T 4:10 PM-7:10 PM,"Gray, Kevin",2,Finance,N,N,,"This half semester course will provide an introduction to real estate development, investment, finance and strategy outside of the United States.  Global investment in financial assets, the need for risk diversification, the increased accuracy of property records, greater transparency, more relaxed laws permitting foreign investment, and population movement around the world—all of these trends have led to a tremendous increase in cross-border real estate investing for both private equity and public companies.  While many studies of international real estate focus on the role of foreign real property in the U. S. institutional portfolio, this course will take a wider and more historical view of the cultural attitudes towards real estate around the world and how they impact the quality and risk of investment assets.  Detailed analysis will begin with property level due diligence in order to provide a fundamental understanding of how and why property markets differ by country beyond simple supply/demand dynamics.  This course will consist of three parts:  a.) a micro-market analysis of real property characteristics in various countries around the world, including financing, leasing and valuation; b.) an analysis of investment vehicles—public and private—available to institutional investors, as well as cross-border transactions, and c.) a macro-market view of world space and capital  markets, the rationale for international investing, trends in capital flows and portfolio composition and the various ways in which risk is measured and mitigated.  Each part of the course will require a brief individual assignment completed over a two-week period.  The first research project will be a study of a significant real property asset outside of the United States, including its market, ownership, legal structure, valuation, and transaction history.  Both the G-8 and G-20 nations will be the object of study, but individual students are free to concentrate on any country of interest.  The second research project will consist of an analysis of a private equity or publicly-traded foreign property company, its current fair value, competitive advantage and future prospects.  An interview with a top executive of a company will be encouraged and facilitated.  The third research project will consist of a comparative analysis of world property markets and the hypothetical investment in a portfolio of real estate assets across three or more foreign property markets.  The course will consist of lectures, discussion, case studies and readings on international real estate from a variety of sources.  No final exam or group project will be required."

Statistical Foundations is a practical, interactive course designed to equip students with the statistical tools necessary for modern financial data analysis. It provides a rigorous, hands-on exploration of advanced statistical methodologies, emphasizing regression techniques tailored for asset pricing research. Students will actively engage with complex financial phenomena throughout the course, using linear regression for prediction, inference, and other advanced topics. The course also introduces time series analysis and advanced estimation methods, such as Maximum Likelihood and Generalized Method of Moments, as crucial tools for aspiring financial analysts. Students are provided with ample opportunities to apply these tools to real-world financial data, using the statistical computing language R."

Although central banks around the world are broadly similar in terms of their mandates and policy instruments, emerging market central banks are different by way of the policy trade-offs they face, the degrees of freedom available to them and the environment in which they operate. As the global economic center of gravity shifts towards the emerging world, an intelligent appreciation of emerging economy perspectives is imperative for acquiring a broad-based worldview of the global economy. In that light, the course will focus on the challenges and dilemmas of central banking in emerging markets. Drawing from international, particularly emerging market experience of the last two decades, the course will prioritize practice over theory and breadth over depth. Although no quantitative models will be used, an understanding of the concepts of macroeconomics is a prerequisite."

Students will use course tools to understand a manager’s role in a company’s value creation and value capture activities.  Using this perspective, we will examine the potential for suppliers, buyers, complementors and traditional rivals to function as both competitors and cooperators to a company in the marketplace.    Emphasis will be placed on anticipating the actions of other marketplace participants by understanding those participants’ objectives and constraints.  The course explicitly recognizes that relevant players in the environment include governments, nonprofit organizations, and corporations and that all of these agents can behave both cooperatively and competitively.   Textbooks required for this course:  Microeconomics (Pindyck and Rubinfeld -whatever edition obtained for Economics is fine) and Coopetition (Brandenberger and Nalebuff)."
10029,MGT411,Customer,M  W 8:30 AM-9:50 AM,"Shin, Jiwoong",2,Core,N,N,,"The course takes the viewpoint that the best way to create and keep a customer is to develop a deep understanding of customer behavior, integrate that understanding across the organization, and align the organizational structure to both satisfy current customer needs and adapt to changes in customer needs better than competitors. To be truly customer-focused and market-driven, a company (profit or nonprofit) should develop the capability to sense and respond to the changing needs of customers in the market. An important element of the course is the idea that customer focus must extend to the entire organization across all its major functions for it to be successful. The course consists of two main modules: (1) Understanding Customers and Creating a Superior Value Proposition and (2) Creating and Maintaining a Customer-Aligned Organization. The first module focuses on understanding customer needs in consumer and industrial markets from a multidisciplinary perspective (economics, psychology, and sociology) to create a superior value proposition; the second highlights how creating a customer-aligned organization requires functional perspectives that span marketing, operations, accounting, finance, and human resource management.

Governments depend on the private sector for investment, employment, and revenue, and sometimes to mitigate political failures. Future managers and leaders of both for-profit and non-profit private sector entities must understand the ways in which their organization’s mission is dependent on government and devise appropriate strategies vis-à-vis the public sector. Conversely, future public sector leaders must be cognizant of the effects of government action on business. This course is designed to expose students to frameworks derived primarily from the fields of economics and political science that help us analyze the social and political environments within which business operates. The first half of the course focuses on analyzing how government institutions affect the conduct of business and how business can shape government and policy. The second half does deeper dives into a number of pressing policy issues (such as gender and racial discrimination, immigration policy, education policy, public health in light of the COVID-19 epidemic, and the role of evidence in policymaking) that have large effects on employees, managers, shareholders, and other stakeholders. Beyond political science and economics, a rigorous analysis of these topics will require us to also draw on scholarship from the fields of law, history and sociology."

Quality depends on professor; Dana/Cusimano praised, Marciano less so.","Business is an activity in which parties exchange goods or services for valuable consideration. The goal of this course is to examine the ethical dimensions of such activities and develop skills for identifying and weighting ethical considerations. The aims are twofold. One, we will discover the tools we use for reasoning about right and wrong at the individual, firm, and policy levels. Discussion and debate about the readings, including on Canvas forums, are a frequent part of the course. Two, we will explore “blind spots” – reasons why people fail to see the ethical dimension of decisions and thus, how they fail to live up to their own ethical standards."

Developing and executing effective communication strategies is essential in a variety of business
settings. Business leaders are often expected to present their message with confidence and clarity to
employees, clients, partners, investors, and the public. This highly interactive, practical course will help
students develop confidence in their public speaking skills through weekly presentations and
assignments, lectures and discussions, guest speakers, simulated activities, and filmed feedback. We will
explore the essentials of communication strategy and persuasion: audience analysis, message
construction, communicator credibility, and delivery. Students at all levels of mastery of public
speaking will benefit from this course."

The same, incidentally, is true for politics. Quarterly earnings, the 24hr news cycle, and social media blips command much of if not most attention. Yet the opportunity set facing business is overwhelmingly shaped by broad macro-trends and systemic risks – call them “big issues.” Climate change, the prevalence of chronic diseases, and urbanization are just some of the trends that will make some industries rise while others fall; challenge managers to reinvent their companies, products, and even themselves; and provide exciting opportunities for global leaders who are change agents and entrepreneurs. 
At the same time, because of business’s ability to adapt to and even steer major change, many stakeholders are looking to the business community to help solve global problems. To meet stakeholder expectations, and to ultimately convert global challenges into business opportunities, aspiring leaders must understand an array of issues that extend far beyond traditional business concerns. Only then can they create ‘shared value’ at the nexus of business and society.
This course is designed to foster participants’ ability to think more holistically about globalization, global trends, and the role of business. It is structured around the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of 17 objectives, backed up by 169 specific targets, that were adopted by the UN in 2015 after broad-based consultations involving governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), academics, and the business community."

The course will examine operational, organizational and financial issues that are prevalent in developing small and medium businesses. Cases will examine startups, acquired companies, family businesses and sponsored businesses (private equity owned). Not for profits will also be considered.  The course will focus on the developing and adolescent stages of the business – beyond start up and prior to maturity or exit. The size of the businesses will roughly be $2m to $100m in annual revenue. Students will discover that organizations of this size can be resource constrained, lack infrastructure and will require innovative and creative solutions and strategies to grow and create value. 
The general nature of the course will give students a complete view of the enterprise and an understanding of what choices can be made to grow the enterprise, improve the enterprise, finance the businesses and create value. Students will be required to assess the current situation of the enterprise and its leader, diagnose the challenges and opportunities and make specific recommendations and action plans with quantitative and qualitative support. Students will learn new skills and concepts while analyzing the cases and will also draw upon the Core foundation. The course will provide students with an opportunity to understand what it is like to lead, run, grow and manage a smaller organization and how this might fit as a career choice.

Executive, students were exposed to the changing role of the CEO and the dynamic of leading
an organization at the intersection of multiple stakeholders, from customers and employees to
investors and society. MGT 840 challenges students to assess the various strategies and
options available to senior management when managing and balancing the interests and
expectations of stakeholders. Should the firm address societal issues and needs or should it
focus on maximizing returns for its owners? On what basis are decisions – capital allocation,
human capital, policy – made? Does a commitment to stakeholders enhance or detract from
the firm’s ability to create long-term value? Which stakeholders should be prioritized? Which
stakeholders should be deprioritized? Students will assess and resolve for themselves the
question: What is the fundamental purpose and responsibilities of the firm?"
10046,MGT844,Finance and Society: The Rise of Private Capital ,T 4:10 PM-7:10 PM,"Ma, Song",2,Finance,N,N,,"Finance is more than just a mechanism for wealth generation; it is a pivotal force that shapes societal structures, influences government policies, and changes social norms. The distribution and management of financial resources can dramatically affect the quality of life, access to opportunities, the overall social fabric of communities, as well as geopolitics.

In recent decades, private capital, including private equity, infrastructure and private credit, has become a significant player in society. Private equity managers control tens of trillions of assets. Large pools of sovereign and private wealth emerge, compete for private assets, accumulate returns and gain influence.  Private capital not only fuels businesses and innovation but also holds significant influence over public policy and social norms. Understanding the dynamics of private capital is crucial for anyone looking to make informed decisions within the financial sector or engage in policy-making that affects economic growth and social equity.

This course is designed for students in finance, economics, public policy, and anyone interested in the intersection of finance and societal development. It offers insights into how financial instruments and decisions can be harnessed to promote sustainable and equitable growth. By examining both the positive and negative impacts of private capital, the course prepares students to contribute thoughtfully and effectively in their future careers, whether in finance, regulation, or social entrepreneurship.

The course is co-taught by Professor Song Ma and Dr. Kevin Lu. Song Ma is a Professor of Finance at Yale School of Management. Kevin Lu is a Partner and Chairman of Asia at Partners Group, a global private equity firm with $147 billion AUM.

More than 50% of the world population lives in cities. These cities use 80% of the world’s energy; consume 60% of the world’s drinking water; and, generate 70% of the world’s carbon emissions. Furthermore, rapid population growth is straining the capacity of cities to provide essential goods and basic services such as electricity, drinking water, sewage, and trash removal, as well as provide a reliable transportation infrastructure. 
Can autonomous cars, buses and taxis help solve this? Can sensors tracking water usage and trash levels help create incentives for city dwellers to consume less and conserve more? Can cameras tracking pedestrian and traffic patterns help reduce congestion and pollution? 
We will discuss many questions in our synopsis of numerous global cities. We will discuss the proliferation of “connectivity” via sensors and computing; the public policies influencing connected cities; the social forces doing the same; and, what this all means for the next chapter of humankind’s development. We will focus our time in these six areas: Data, Energy, Food, Infrastructure, Public Services, and Water."

The course primarily takes the perspective of an entrepreneur. Broadly speaking, entrepreneurial financing decisions have a life cycle. The cycle begins with identifying opportunities, moves to marshaling resources to take advantage of these opportunities and executing the business plan, and ends with harvesting the venture's success. Accordingly, the course has three sections: Identifying and Valuing Opportunities, Structuring Deals, and Harvesting Opportunities. This course combines lectures and case studies. The lecture part will equip students with important techniques in each stage of entrepreneurial finance; those techniques are applied to case studies covering interesting entrepreneurial areas such as IT, healthcare, sharing economy, impact investment, etc.

The class will discuss investment risk, asset valuation and portfolio management, as well as the management of investment organizations, research methods, decision making, compensation and incentive structures and their investor base. Guest speakers may also discuss their strategic opportunities to help portfolio companies build value or investments realize value. Endowment managers will discuss how they find, assess and work with investment managers. After an introduction to investment management principles, weeks 2-5 will feature leading investment managers who will describe their investment approach, team, sourcing and decision-making and risk management. Investors will discuss ideal characteristics of quality, value and opportunity and present one or two companies with those winning attributes as well as some investments that have not worked out as expected and why. Before the speakers come to class, students will choose from an assigned set, one company or asset that best represents the managers’ ideal investment and explain why. Students will also choose an investment that does not fit or should be sold.  Students will write a summary about the managers, their approach and the student’s assessment of the best and least appropriate investment. These will be presented and discussed in class.

Venture capital and private equity play a critical role in the financing and development of high-growth entrepreneurial companies. This course takes the perspective of venture investors, and will cover the tools, methods, and mindset used by venture capitalist to operate, invest, and create value. Many of these skills and insights are readily generalizable to other PE models. The course is structured around the “VC/PE cycle.” It starts from setting up a VC firm, fundraising from limited partners (LPs), and the contracting problem with LPs. The cycle moves to selecting and valuing an entrepreneurial company and structuring a deal. We then investigate the management of investments and value creation. Finally, we study the exit of investments and the risks and returns of the PE asset class. This course combines lectures and case studies. The lecture portion of the course is designed to equip students with key techniques and background knowledge; these techniques will be applied to case studies to help us solve practical problems in VC/PE investment.

Although the primary emphasis is on strategy at the individual business level, and the primary source of analytical methods is economics, other application areas (including finance, marketing, and organizational behavior) and other analytical perspectives are considered. The course provides the analytical and data analysis tools to balance the objectives, characteristics, and resources of the organization on the one hand, and the opportunities presented by the environment on the other. We will also focus understanding competitive interaction between firms, both in theory and in a variety of industry settings. The range of organizations studied includes nonprofits as well as for-profits. Class sessions are a mixture of case discussions and lectures.

This course has a mandatory weekly lab meeting most Tuesdays from 6:30p-9:30p. This course also has a mandatory off-campus weekend retreat (see dates below). Studies have shown that the average manager spends about two-thirds of their time interacting with others. It should be no surprise that skill in interpersonal relationships is one of the most frequent determinants of managerial success or failure. This course is designed to help students learn some of the skills necessary for successfully navigating and leading in the face of fast-paced, complex human interaction. The central focus is to increase students' ability to understand and diagnose interpersonal dynamics as well as to increase personal understanding of how they impact others.
This course is a memory-making, powerful and even transformational experience for many students. While readings and group exercises are used to begin discussion, the core learning material emerges in small group interaction. Students learn how they function in small groups and how they relate to others from feedback and reaction of other class members. As such, students planning to enroll should understand that the course methodologies are likely quite different than most courses you have taken to date. Much of the learning will emerge from a) personal reflection on interpersonal and group dynamics and b) the ability/willingness to learn interpersonally from experience, risk-taking, self-disclosure, and feedback.
Interested students are encouraged to attend first session to better understand this unique course experience.  Attendance is required for the first two classes to retain a place in the course or on the waiting list. This course has a mandatory weekly lab meeting most Tuesdays from 6:30p-9:30p.

Policy modeling is most useful when the amounts of data, money, time, and other resources one would like for purely scientific investigation are highly constrained by the decision-making environment.  Recognizing that analyses of all sorts often exhibit diminishing returns in insight to effort, the idea is to capture key features of various policy issues with relatively simple “first-strike” models that provide support for decision making. Building on earlier coursework in probability modeling, decision analysis and economics, the techniques introduced include ""back of the envelope"" probabilistic models such as Bernoulli, Poisson, Markov and elementary renewal processes, hazard functions, queueing theory, and epidemic modeling. Simple cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness approaches are integrated with the above. The course will feature applications to problems drawn from public health, criminal justice, public housing, and counterterrorism.  Students will be responsible for attending all classes and reading assigned articles.  There will be weekly problem sets which must be submitted on-time to receive credit, and a take-home exam scheduled for the latter part of the semester.

10066,MGT629,Ethical Choices in Public Leadership,F 8:30 AM-11:15 AM,"Braverman, Eric",4,International,N,Y,,"All public leaders must make choices that challenge their code of ethics. Sometimes, a chance of life or death is literally at stake: how and when should a leader decide to let some people die, or explicitly ask people to die to give others a chance to live? At other times, while life or death may not be at stake, a leader must still decide difficult issues: when to partner with unsavory characters, when to admit failure, when to release information or make choices transparent. The pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and continued instability around the world all make clearer than ever the consequences of decisions in one community that can affect the entire world. This interdisciplinary seminar draws on perspectives from law, management, and public policy in exploring how leaders develop their principles, respond when their principles fail or conflict, and make real-world choices when, in fact, there are no good choices. Both permission of the instructor and application are required. Submit your application HERE.

In this interdisciplinary clinic taught between the School of Architecture, School of Law, and School of Management, and organized by the Yale Urban Design Workshop, students will gain hands-on, practical experience in architectural and urban development and social entrepreneurship while contributing novel, concrete solutions to the housing affordability crisis in Connecticut.
 Working in teams directly with local community-based non-profits, students will co-create detailed development proposals and architectural designs anchored by affordable housing, but which will also engage with a range of community development issues including environmental justice, sustainability, resilience, social equity, identity, food scarcity, mobility, and health.
 Through seminars and workshops with Yale faculty and guest practitioners, students will be introduced to the history, theory, issues, and contemporary practices in the field, and will get direct feedback on their work. Offered in partnership with the Connecticut Department of Housing (DOH) as part of the Connecticut Plan for Healthy Cities, student projects will center on community wealth building and equitable economic recovery in some of Connecticut’s most economically distressed neighborhoods, by proposing multi-sector, place-based projects that focus on housing, health, and economic development. Proposals will have the opportunity to receive funding from the State both towards the implementation of rapidly deployed pilot projects during the course period, as well as towards predevelopment activities for larger projects, such as housing rehabilitation or new building construction.
 Students in the course will be organized into multi-disciplinary teams including law, management, and architecture students, who will ideate together and take on specific team roles, modeling real-world project development teams. Teams will be assigned to work with non-profit developers tackling development or redevelopment projects that include affordable housing. Facilities of the Yale Urban Design Workshop will be available to students of the course. Students may have the opportunity to continue their leadership in these projects following the end of the course, in a professional capacity, as they move towards implementation.
 Students will interact with their nonprofit partners, the Connecticut Commissioner of Housing, Connecticut Housing Finance Authority, and the Connecticut Green Bank.

We define social innovation as finding a novel solution to a complex social problem that is more effective, efficient, sustainable, or just than existing solutions, disrupts the status quo, and creates value on a societal rather than individual level. Yet before we innovate, we must research and reflect on root causes, available alternatives, stakeholders, resources, and existing systems; and also take into consideration different pathways to social change, under different societal structures and belief systems. Over the course of this semester, we will read and discuss the textbook, “Social Entrepreneurship: Building Impact Step by Step,” which provides a ten stage framework for creating social change. This includes cases from different sectors including education, environment, health, nutritional justice, women’s socioeconomic empowerment, social financing and investing, financial inclusion, and ecosystem entrepreneurship. Students will be invited to critique the book’s framework and adapt it to topics of their choice.

Health equity means that everyone has a fair and just opportunity to be as healthy as possible. This requires addressing obstacles to health such as poverty, racism, gender and other biases and their consequences, including powerlessness and lack of access to good jobs with fair pay, quality education and housing, healthy foods, safe environments, and health care. We refer to these as drivers of health. The cases in this course bring to light the complexities in drivers of health, and the role of entrepreneurship and cross-sectoral collaboration in eliminating health disparities. Class discussions are aimed at providing students with experience in understanding potential benefits and pitfalls of applying public health entrepreneurship to improve health equity and drivers of health.
We examine cases of entrepreneurship for health equity in the U.S. and globally, using a research-based framework to analyze the role of design justice, resource mobilization, financial viability, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and systems strengthening. Cases include start-ups and new ventures within existing institutions, referred to as intrapreneurship. We also examine cases of collective impact, or innovating across multiple institutions. Over the years, students in this class have began referring to these as extrapreneurship. This course brings together students from the Schools of Management, Public Health, Environment, Global Affairs, Divinity, Engineering, Arts and Sciences, and undergraduates.

This course will equip students with the knowledge and skills to build sustainable data-driven businesses within the healthcare and life sciences sectors. We will begin by surveying the healthcare data ecosystem and turn to how the data generated by the system can create business value. Along the way, we will become familiar with the foundational concepts of healthcare informatics and the sub-discipline of clinical research informatics, which provide essential frameworks for understanding how to generate, manage, and use healthcare data.
We will then look more broadly at models for treating data as an asset and consider how those models apply to healthcare data. We will wrap up by exploring how to assess the business value of healthcare data and how to build processes that enhance that value.
In this course, students will shift between two informative perspectives: that of a healthcare data analyst charged with assessing and recommending a healthcare data strategy and an entrepreneur assessing new opportunities in the space. As we work through identifying opportunities and challenges, we will practice asking essential questions and gain first-hand experience in research and business-process-analysis methods used to answer them. We will also examine innovative businesses focused on healthcare data and analytics."

It is important to note that this course is not aimed as a practical guide to entrepreneurship – we will not write business plans, for example. Rather, its goal is to discuss current approaches to entrepreneurship in management, psychology, sociology, and economics. Having said this, if your goal is to start your own company, I am sure that the theoretical approaches that we will cover will help you make more informed decisions.
This course will use a mixture of case studies, simulation exercises, and academic articles to explore essential elements of the entrepreneurial process. During the course we will explore topics such as: i) the founding of a new venture, ii) deciding to be a solo-entrepreneur or part of a founding team, and iii) developing a prototype. We will also discuss the theory and practice of obtaining financial resources and growing the venture. Finally, we will discuss long-term plans and possible exit strategies."

Please be prepared and committed to engage in class.  If you do not enjoy contributing in class, this might not be the right course for you.  This course will use and apply various valuation techniques and financial analysis.  The course will not use class time to teach valuation or financial analysis.  While it is not a prerequisite, a basic understanding of valuation and financial analysis is helpful.  If you need additional help with valuation or financial analysis, please see the TAs and Instructor for support which can be provided outside of class.  The purpose of this course is to provide students with an opportunity to explore rollups, consolidations and serial acquisitions as a growth and value creation strategy in an entrepreneurial context.  Consolidations have been pursued in manufacturing and services businesses since the mid 1800s when oil and railroad trusts existed.  More recently, consolidations have existed in death care services, uniform rental services, manufacturing, food services and financial services.  The focus will be on the nature of serial acquisitions as compared to episodic, transformational transactions.  This course will explore why this strategy is so compelling to managers and investors.  The course instructor completed 38 acquisitions in the records management industry as the CEO of ArchivesOne and 22 acquisitions in the bottleless water industry as the CEO of Onesource Water.  Additionally, the instructor has invested in many serial acquisition companies. Official and unofficial auditing is not permitted.

The course is organized around a series of cases (largely focusing on investment led by or involving SOM graduates)  that allow us to dig deep into decisions made by PE firms in implementing value creation strategies — 
•	What messages is the firm getting from their own investors (such as institutional limited partners?)
•	What quantitative and qualitative tools can be brought to bear to help frame decisions?
•	How does a firm identify, diligence, and quantify salient market and operational factors in framing a value creation plan?
•	How does the firm gain confidence in its ability to execute on a value creation plan, and assess the risk around that plan?
•	How and should the firm incorporate ESG factors into decision-making?
The class will be limited to 20 students.  Preparation and class participation are strongly encouraged.  Some cases will be done individually, some in teams."

These challenges are especially pronounced in global virtual teams (GVTs), where cultural differences, time zone variations, and other issues can hinder team effectiveness.

This course builds on foundational principles of managing organizations, groups, and teams through an action-learning approach, allowing you to apply knowledge and skills in practice. You’ll participate in exercises that simulate the issues faced by GVTs, focusing sometimes on the “global” aspect, sometimes on the “virtual,” and often both.

The course is structured into three modules:
•	MODULE 1 | GVT Class Sessions | 16:10-18:10, Tuesdays and Thursdays, January 21, 24, 28, 30, and February 4, 2025 | These exercise and simulation-based sessions build on concepts and frameworks introduced earlier in the curriculum, aiming to deepen your knowledge in building, managing, and leading effective teams in global and virtual settings.
•	MODULE 2 | GVT Negotiation Exercise | January 30 – February 28, 2025 | Jointly conducted with 10+ GNAM partner schools, this module places you in a GVT with students from different schools around the world. You’ll complete an interactive learning exercise involving team-building, coordination, decision-making, and cross-team analysis.

Accordingly, the goal of this class is to help you develop the knowledge and skills that enable you to manage power and influence successfully and make a lasting impact on the world.
 
We will begin by thinking about what power is and why you do (or do not) want it. What does it mean to have power over your choices, your career, and your trajectory? If you had unlimited power, what would you do with it? What roadblocks – structural, social, and psychological – get in the way? We will then shift to learning the tools that can enable you to harness and use power effectively and ethically; i.e. to use your power with purpose.
 
This course will combine theory with practice. We will learn time-tested strategies of power and influence, and discuss emerging research on contemporary dynamics (such as influence in the age of social media and the power of social movements).

The course aims to introduce important ideas and tools from game theory, and use them to answer questions in social sciences, law, and business.  For instance, how does information get sold and used to persuade? How do we think about the efficiency and equity of allocations? How do sellers decide the best format for an auction to sell a good? Does requiring unanimous verdicts guarantee that the innocent will not be convicted? What causes bank runs? When do we see price wars? The underlying ideas will include games of incomplete information, mechanism design, common knowledge and high-order reasoning, and repeated games."
10130,MGT641,Behavioral Finance,M  W 10:10 AM-11:30 AM,"Barberis, Nicholas",2,Finance,N,N,,"The traditional framework for thinking about financial markets assumes that all market participants are fully rational. The past two decades have seen the emergence of an important new paradigm, behavioral finance, which argues that many financial phenomena are the result of less than fully rational thinking and which draws on psychology to understand the ways in which people are not fully rational. This course provides an introduction to the field. We revisit basic topics in finance from a behavioral finance perspective: topics related to markets (stock market fluctuations, popular investment strategies, bubbles); topics related to investor behavior (poor investment decisions by households); and topics related to corporate finance (security issuance, mergers and acquisitions). A running theme in the course is that knowledge of behavioral finance is essential for anyone who seeks a full understanding of modern financial markets. There are no prerequisites – the course is self-contained – but some students like to take it in conjunction with the Spring-1 course MGT 854, “Behavioral Economics”."
10131,MGT668,Narratives in Health Media,W 4:10 PM-7:10 PM,"Hamblin, James",2,Strategy,N,N,"Focus on communication, storytelling, combating misinformation. Light workload, creative writing.","Trust in science among the public is at a recent-historic low, and there are powerful forces working to keep it that way. If experts do not actively engage in the information landscape, their work risks being undone or lost. If they interact in the wrong ways, they could end up only contributing more to the chaos and division that currently characterize the information landscape. Opting out is not an option; we all have public faces now, and the question is how best to develop and utilize them. Given the state of division and distrust that threaten science, it should likely be among the aspirations of every graduate with an interest in healthcare management, science, medicine, and/or public health to have some part in shaping narratives that promote health and fact-based discourse over angry, divisive stagnation. This course invites students to study ways in which it can be done, and to reflect on their own potential, and to try out different techniques and different platforms—to begin to find their public voice. To see what works for some messages and some communicators, and what fails, and why. 
 
 The course will introduce and study the increasingly broad array of tools to engage in public discourse, to reach people outside of their immediate circles of professional contacts, and to influence the lives of many. It is predicated on the idea that science cannot be conceived as a system by which knowledge emanates outward (much less downward) from academia, or it will cease to reach people and to affect the world, but only exacerbate distrust and claims of elitism. Rather science can only exist as an active process of communication between researchers and the public. This is how trust is built and the learning process is most effective, as a mutual, shared endeavor. This is a widely held conception of science, and yet the actual methods of such engagement are overlooked or ignored by many in the health sciences. 
 
 This course is not prescriptive, but is meant to engage critically with modes of communication and shaping discourse. The course will equip students to critically analyze emerging methods of health-oriented communication. It will offer a survey of many approaches wherein students will develop an understanding of the canonical paths to writing for large audiences (op-eds, long-form journalism)—as well as explore how narratives emerge over time in much smaller and more personal scales. We will study the role that experts play in creating media on their own platforms and by working with media outlets as either sources or contributors, consultants or editors or publishers.  It is critical that not all experts communicate in the same styles and on the same platforms. Writing an op-ed in The New York Times is valuable, for example, but the ability to do that is just one tool in what needs to be an arsenal of ways of reaching people across cultural, socioeconomic, ideological, intellectual, and educational backgrounds."""
10132,MGT678,Understanding and Reducing Bias in Organizations,T  Th 2:40 PM-4:00 PM,"Owens, Jayanti",2,Organizational Behavior,N,Y,,"This course helps students understand what bias is, why it matters, and how it shapes inequality in important organizational processes (e.g., teamwork, hiring, advancement). We will also examine what the science says about whether, when, and which strategies can help reduce bias in organizations. We begin by understanding scientific evidence around how bias can operate as an interpersonal, organizational, and structural process and how it can impede organizational effectiveness. We then examine strategies for reducing the effects of bias both among individuals at the interpersonal level and among organizations as it exists within organizational cultures. We will also examine where the science is limited and why reducing the effects of bias in a sustained way can be difficult. Finally, we will address strategies for fostering inclusive organizational cultures and creating organizational change. Importantly, this course will focus on bias and inequality along lines of race/ethnicity and gender in the U.S. because this is where the science is most developed. However, we welcome student discussion around how the principles we discuss can be extended to global organizations and to other dimensions of difference along which bias can operate (e.g., social class background, nationality, LGBTQ identity, religion, disability, and more). This course is designed for students who want to become sophisticated thinkers about how employees from diverse backgrounds experience bias and inequality in recruitment, evaluation, and advancement, what the science says about how organizations can foster inclusion, and what they can do as individual managers and leaders to promote diversity and inclusion in their workplaces and in society more broadly."

Our objective is to help you learn about and come to appreciate basic features of the creative process, including creative development and a number of different psychological and cultural approaches to creativity, as well as issues involved in managing creativity effectively, including leadership, managing creative people, teams and projects, creativity initiatives, and organizational response to change. How do creative ideas happen? How can we foster our creativity and the creativity of those around us? What are the paths of creative development of individuals who are successful in their creative endeavors? What are the obstacles to creativity? What is the nature of creativity in teams and organizations? These are some of the questions we will address.  We study creativity in many domains, including business, science and technology, the arts, and life in general, relying on a mixture of lectures, readings, and discussion. We engage in a variety of exercises, including exercises in which you will explore your own creativity and group exercises in which you engage in creative activity with others. We also learn through cases, about creativity in business and how organizations foster creativity and manage creative processes. Creativity is fascinating and incredibly important for society, and hopefully you will gain a greater and greater appreciation for this in the course of our work and later as you reflect back upon our work and continue to learn about creativity, on the job and in your life."

It blends theoretical knowledge with hands-on application. Students gain a deeper view into UX design's origins and foundational philosophies and how those have evolved into the core methodologies and strategies used by design practitioners and leaders today. Students then have the opportunity to apply these perspectives and methodologies through in-class workshops and a group capstone project.

This course will include a combination of:
* Lectures
* Case studies & discussion
* In-class workshops/exercises
* Group capstone project
* Guest speakers (TBD)

The course is organized into 4 modules. The first will focus on developing a foundational understanding of design as a practice generally: its origins, foundational philosophies and intents. The second centers on a survey of commonly used UX design processes, their intentions, goals, limitations and dependencies on functions (engineering, product management, marketing etc) in the context of digital product development. This is also when the course capstone project is introduced. Module three examines the relationship between design ethics and innovation . Lastly, module four focuses on fundamentals of design management and leadership: cultivating creativity, balancing quality and speed, and choosing the right type of org structure to enable getting the most out of what design has to offer.  

Students can expect to walk away with a deeper understanding of design as a practice - at both a societal and commercial level - and practical knowledge of the strategies, methodologies and tools available to deliver well-considered, thoughtful digital product solutions."

At least in renewable energy, the last 35 years have seen booms followed by spectacular busts.  While the recent collapse of several renewable energy companies--including the much publicized Solyndra--may suggest that this cycle is not much different than the last, many entrepreneurs are still forming green companies.  In addition, the ranks of climate change skeptics grows ever thinner in spite of the increase in political partisanship around climate change and renewable energy.
 This course will explore how investing in renewable energy is different than in investing in more prosaic sectors.  These differences include capital intensity, commodity markets, mature industry structure, local and federal regulation, and market imperfections.  The course will also review the differences in policy support given to renewable energy in other countries.  While the emphasis is on renewable energy, many of the same issues obtain in considering other green technologies—from water to new packaging.  The course will rely on real-life case studies to illustrate themes and to expose students to different end markets and to companies along the maturity cycle from early stage ventures to projects using mature technology.  In so doing, the course will give some insights as to specialized participants --VC, Private Equity, and Project Finance—fit together in funding a company.  Students should expect to leave the class better prepared to address major issues and seize new opportunities in clean energy finance. 
 While the course will use the lens of an investor, most of the issues are the same from the standpoint of a business owner seeking to finance renewable energy activities and a policy maker seeking to encourage capital formation in the sector.  Non-SOM students who have background in finance and in business strategy are encouraged and welcome to participate with permission of the instructor."""

As Howard M. Schilit writes in his book Financial Shenanigans, “dishonest companies continue to find new tricks (and recycle old favorites) to fool investors,” taking advantage of “grey areas” in the accounting rules to exaggerate the positive and downplay the negative.   What types of financial fraud are most prevalent?  How are they revealed?  What red flags should one look for?  What lessons can we derive from the study of past financial frauds to inform our use of forensic tools to uncover future frauds?  How does financial euphoria and its self-momentum undermine caution, staunch skepticism, and encourage misperceptions? What is ""control"" fraud?  Does ""legal"" fraud exist in finance?"

In business, the impact ranges from commonplace predictive improvements at one end of the spectrum to opportunities for creating entirely new markets at the other. As background, the course will briefly introduce students to Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning methods comprising of Unsupervised, Supervised and Reinforcement Learning. Through a combination of lectures and case studies, we will evaluate how to integrate AI into decision making, and examine the strategic choices facing companies developing and using AI / ML technologies. We will evaluate how both consumers and decision-makers evaluate decisions made by AI systems, and the feasibility of explainable AI. The course will also examine issues at the intersection of AI and Society including fairness and bias that are proving to be especially challenging, and an understanding of how both consumers and decision-makers evaluate decisions made by AI systems.

This course encourages you to challenge (i.e., avoid being limited by) your current intuitions, though experiments, surveys & statistical models.  At an organizational level, the proper use of experimental methods will confer a great advantage over those who do not conduct rigorous experiments.  Moreover, instilling an experimental “culture” promotes humility (because experimental results pose a perpetual and imminent threat to those who most stridently voice their current opinions and positions) and “flattens” organizational hierarchies (because the ability to generate novel manipulations or make correct predictions can rival seniority or occupational rank as a source of prestige and power).   On a more personal level, learning how to “think like a scientist” should help demystify scientific jargon and give you the confidence to seriously scrutinize scientific (and pseudoscientific) claims, many of which are utter nonsense.

The course will aim to convince students that “political ethics” is not an oxymoron; rather, it is a balancing of stakeholder expectations, personal beliefs and an organization’s mission-driven purpose. Every type of organization – for-profit and nonprofit entities, consulting and law firms, even governments themselves – and the leaders of these organizations - must come to terms with evolving political ethics in our contentious times. The course will specifically address debates about corporate social responsibility (CSR), environmental, social and corporate governance standards (ESG) and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).  The course provides a legal practitioner’s perspective, drawing on high profile scenarios and applications of legal and ethical frameworks to common situations. The course blends law, policy and existing curriculum about executive leadership, applied ethics and business & society in a manner accessible to graduate, undergraduate and interdisciplinary students.

The main emphasis is on managing uncertain demand, both within the firm and across the supply chain. We seek both rigor and relevance, through case discussions and by illustrating how mathematical analysis can be applied to real supply chain management challenges. While tactical models and decisions are part of this course, the emphasis is on the qualitative insights needed by general managers or management consultants.

If you do not enjoy contributing in class, this might not be the right course for you.
Using the Socratic case method, this course will explore several of the many ways to be an entrepreneur. MBA students frequently express interest in doing something entrepreneurial after completing their graduate degree program. Most MBA students with an interest in entrepreneurship consider only a narrow range of potential business opportunities. This course will highlight the multiple ways to become an entrepreneur.
Entrepreneurship, using HBS Professor Howard Stevenson’s definition of ”pursuing an opportunity beyond the resources controlled,” is a big tent. Although Silicon Valley technology ventures and flashy consumer products startups receive most of the attention in the media and on campus, there are other ways to jump into the entrepreneurial arena. This course explores six distinct patterns in entrepreneurship (and there might be many more), some of which fly under the radar of many MBA students. This course will not advocate any single pattern of entrepreneurship over the others; rather, the course will encourage students to discover the best potential path for themselves using a ten-step framework for analysis. 
There is no right or wrong pattern in entrepreneurship – aspiring entrepreneurs owe it to themselves to learn about and contemplate a variety of options. Then, with better information and a higher degree of confidence, they can rigorously evaluate which entrepreneurial path best suits their specific interests, needs, and goals. Additionally, aspiring entrepreneurs should factor risk and lifestyle into their decision-making process. Which form of entrepreneurship has the highest probability of success, however you define it? And which one will best accommodate the lifestyle you envision for yourself? Official and unofficial auditing is not permitted.

 However, the traditional literature of crisis communication says little about preparing for or managing a financial crisis.  In this course you will learn the basic theories of crisis communications and the various communication frameworks and techniques used to respond to crises.

This course has three primary objectives: • Deepen your understanding of macroeconomic models and the empirical evidence that lie behind current monetary policy debates • Help you to better understand the decisions of monetary policy makers and to judge the appropriateness of such decisions • Improve your ability to think and write critically on monetary policy issues With regard to the third objective, this is a WR course and an important goal is for you to gain skill and confidence in writing relatively short, analytical, policy-related essays (about five pages) with supporting material (tables, graphs, regressions).  A great deal of the work at policymaking institutions is carried out through such documents, and considerable public debate is conducted this way as well (through blog posts, for example)."

This course takes a comprehensive view of the value-adding impact of top corporate leaders and how they revolutionize their enterprises, their industries, and the world economy. The subject matter will embrace and integrate such broad key dimensions of strategic change as economic context, shifting markets, emerging technologies, corporate life stage, company culture, and corporate governance together with the character, skill-set, and life stages of individual leaders.   
 The course mission involves three equally important goals. The first is to help students anticipate the multi-dimensional cross-disciplinary aspects of successful planned change from strategic systems to group dynamics and individual psychology. A second is to appreciate the consequences of the unintended effects of strategic change initiatives on work communities and societies at-large. The last is to provide students with an overview of the contemporary industry-specific challenges in an effort to highlight the varied leadership values and skills that are not always apparent as corporations make acquisitions or managers select careers. The course materials used to fulfill this mission require students to be comfortable with a wide variety of learning tools including: research articles; case studies; current industry periodicals; spirited class discussion; role playing; video; and frequent prominent industry leaders as class visitors. 
 Following an overview that builds an analytic framework for the course, the key dimensions of strategic change will be examined through a sequence of industry-by-industry settings including: professional services; financial services; retail; e-commerce; communications and media; recreation and travel; government and nonprofit; industrial and consumer products.

The course seeks to provide students with an introduction to the range of sustainability issues and challenges that companies face in today’s fast-changing marketplace. It introduces key corporate sustainability terms, concepts, tools, strategies, and frameworks based on the overarching theory that the traditional profit-maximizing mission of business (often called shareholder primacy) is giving way to a new vision of stakeholder responsibility that still seeks to provide good returns to the enterprise’s owners but also acknowledges obligations to employees, suppliers, customers, communities, and society more broadly. The course combines lectures, case studies, and class discussions on management theory and tools, the legal and regulatory frameworks that shape the business-environment interface, and the evolving role of business in society.

Hormats, whose combined experience spans the Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Clinton, and Obama administrations, as well as decades on Wall Street. The course is based on the premise that America’s role and policies in the global economy are undergoing a profound change that will outlast the current administration in Washington. It will examine the major forces in the U.S. and abroad that will be determining America’s future in the global economy and the likely policies it will follow for the next decade. These will include changes in the country’s industrial and financial structures, new social pressures, new demographic patterns, and evolving political alignments. Typical of the kinds of questions to be examined will be: How will the changing labor force affect America’s interest in the global arena? How will changing technology affect these interests? What about changes in energy and the environment? What will trade policy, policy toward foreign investment and immigration policy look like? How should we think about the changing roles of Wall Street, Corporate America, and Silicon Valley? Regarding developments abroad, we will ask questions such as these: How will China’s evolving interests, or new directions for the European Union, or the changing position of big emerging markets, or new pressures in global finance influence American policy, and with what effect? If the U.S. attempts to reduce its international involvement, who will write and try to enforce the “rules of the game?” Given the centrality of the United States to the global economy, the course will be important global background for future leaders in any profession."

Today, international work requires at least a basic understanding of how China works and how international organizations work effectively with and in the country. International scholars, businesspeople, civil society practitioners, and journalists seek to understand and explain, shape and influence, and benefit from China’s rapidly developing economy and society. In so doing, these institutions and individuals encounter a political economy that defies traditional modernization theories that predict a high correlation between economic development and democratization. Rather, international actors encounter a system many scholars describe as “resilient authoritarianism,” characterized by opacity and predictability, rigidity and adaptability, repression and lenience, top-down and bottom-up governance, and by rhetoric aimed at international actors that is both welcoming and defensive. Most recently, given changes in the geopolitical environment, the political atmosphere related to China in the home countries of many international organizations is also shifting, and hardening, requiring multifaceted risk analysis and risk mitigation strategies. What is the nature of the Chinese political system? How have international actors navigated the contradictions in the system over time? What is the trajectory of the Chinese political system? And what are the implications for international organizations working there? This course explores these questions through five cases studies in the fields of academic exchange, business, civil society, multilateral diplomacy, and journalism to analyze how organizations manage their operations in China to achieve their goals. The course is taught by a practitioner who managed academic exchange programs, international businesses, and global NGOs in China for twenty-five years. This course is cross-listed from Jackson.
